		<h2>Pokemon Data</h2>
		<p>Due to a cascade of events involving a re-opened Ultra Wormhole, a lost Hoopa, and Arceus literally sending more afterwards for biodiversity reasons, there is now a permanant population of Pokemon on Starter Planet.<br>
		Charles alchemized a pokedex that has the ability to gather data on a pokemon automatically from various sources. After a lopsided online poll, it was dubbed the UltraDex. It has an ultra ball pattern! of course we're gonna call it the ultradex! Like, I know, it could have been called the Hyperdex or the cooldex or whatever, but bluh.
		</p>
		<p>In this section, Data gathered from everyone's ultradex will be compiled here.
