Another quiet week, but at least p decent.\n\n[u]Progress with New Charcherry[/u]\n\nHeir of Time Thoren Emit has been negotiating with the Jinglorian Construction Union to decide an arrangement that would be beneficial to both parties in regards to the building of New Charcherry. Reportedly, it has been decided that the Union will proceed to build at their usual pace, while specific holiday festivities spearheaded by Thoren will largely involve temporary structures such as tents and removable items. Both parties apparently are supportive of this arrangement.\nThe completion of construction will likely occur at some point in 2021.\n\n[u]Cookies![/u]\n\nBrae Emit of Autumnal has apparently managed to conquer the legalese-esque limitations of her ability to give food to others as a fae, and in celebration sent baggies of cookies to everyone she knows. Thankfully there were minimal potential allergens present, though Heir of Breath June Egbert reportedly called upon Heir of Time Thoren Emit to scan her cookies for traces of peanuts. There were no traces of peanuts.\nThe cookies turned out great and I wish Brae the best of luck with her future cooking endeavors!\n\n[u]Wheel Breaker Challenge[/u]\n\nRogue of Heart Charles has thankfully been somewhat tame as of late. With the usage of his forge on Desertia, a peculiar, yellow, glasslike by-product was reportedly formed along its edges. It had been removed, but has yet to be broken by any known force. Charles has rolled the material into a hoop shape, and has taken it to right outside the lab with a challenge to any who may hope to leave their mark upon it.\n\nAnyone who succeeds in breaking this material first shall get a prize of a very large blue cookie, presumably with proof of the feat shown to Charles. So far, minimal attempts have been made with minimal results. It is not water soluble.\n\nThe holidays are getting closer and closer! There's been talk about a Secret Santa, but there's been a lack of organization so I'm just sorta waiting for things to get put together on the back-end on that.
