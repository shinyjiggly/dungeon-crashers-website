		<h2>Locations of Interest</h2>
		<h3>Physical Locations:</h3>
		<div class="biobox">New Charcherry – <br>
		Formerly known as Charcherry, it was dubbed as such after the forest was nearly burnt down by Rogue of Heart Charles. This was done in response to a parasite that had taken over Witch of Life Kat, who had threatened the life of the planet with infected cherry trees. Kat and the parasite died a Just death at the hands of a fallen tree, fell by Heir of Time Rise Emit. They hold that it was an accident, as they had only chopped down a number of trees in blind rage over the burning of their treehouse. This event occured before the Red Rift so there may be some details that no longer apply, but its still the closest thing the town has to a name origin story.
		<br>Charcherry was the place for the first settlement of the V2 Players after they have won the game for some time. After the Purity Temple dungeon had later drained the life out of the area, Prince of Time Garnett Garren and Mage of Light Nick Card took what was left and regrew the land using their powers combined. It is now a new town inhabited primarily by elves, surrounded by both pink foilage resembling cherry blossoms and actual cherry trees, as well as pink animals, which can be found all over New Charcherry’s home, Starter Planet. Every year there is a celebration held by the elves to commemorate the day of their rescue from their meteor-stricken home planet of Jingloria.<br>
		The planet that New Charcherry is located on, Starter Planet, is a protected nature refuge under Desertian territory.</div><br>
		<div class="biobox">Unity Village - <br>
		A village directly east of New Charcherry, it was established to encourage the peaceful co-existance of people and pokemon on Starter Planet. It is home to a pokemon center, a research facility, a pokemon ranch, and a pokemon gym. Brae Emit is the current mayor.</div><br>
		<div class="biobox">Slowpoke Island - <br>
		An island on the other side of the world relative to New Charcherry on Starter Planet, it was created when a sudden blast of lava from the core was forced to the surface by the sinking of a massive tower in Charcherry forest. There used to be an ultra wormhole here, where a number of the first pokemon emerged from. At some point, a voidco dungeon threatened to suck the island dry, but was thankfully crashed in a few week's time. This island has since been replanted, and as a result was cultivated into a paradise. The berries that were planted here feed a great amount of bug types, who in turn feed many other pokemon present.</div><br>
		<div class="biobox">Desertia – <br>
		Once an empty sand ball with just the AC Memorial Robotics Lab and a greenhouse, Desertia now also has a small town encased in a glass dome known as the Desertia Town (now with TWO greenhouses!), ruled by it’s president, Witch of Time Katyleen Kitten. Desertia’s role was at first as a diplomatically convenient pitstop near a major interstellar trade route, but is now basically the Dungeon Crashers’ HQ. Gene’s Garden v2 was also moved from Charcherry to here for… some reason. There is a market square which has a variety of persistant and rotating market stalls. A Hospital/pokemon center can be found here, as well as a courthouse where desertian law is practiced. There is also an ice cream truck parked somewhere.</div><br>
		<div class="biobox">Autumnal – <br>
		One of the four seasonal planets in the Horae system. The other three are Vernal [spring], Aestival [summer], and Burmal [winter]). Autumnal is a planet of eternal fall, home to Brae Emit, Warlock of Time Coleman, and occasionally Heir of Time Rise Emit. A cabin and a garden can be found here, belonging to Brae. A variety of fall-time produce and a single chicken named Cirrus can be also found here. Much of this world is blanketed by trees with spectacularly vibrant foilage. There is an enchantment here which prevents any and all conflict, so it is considered a designated safe zone. It cannot be reached by external means, thanks to an enchanted asteroid belt that surrounds the system, designed to hide it flawlessly.</div><br>
		<div class="biobox">Korous – <br>
		A hot, somewhat mostly desert planet that is home to the Temporics and STOMB. It is also home to Fort Aspara, where the Warp Zone is located. Korous exists because of Chronos’s meddling with the component frogs and injecting a code causing this planet to appear with species bearing his likeness. In [death]stuck, Chronos also used Prince of Time Garnett Garren’s glassestop with the exile program installed onto it to influence the people of Korous over time to have them worship him as a god. Korous is also undergoing an ongoing terraforming project, in which Garnett played a large role in. It will likely take countless years, as this planet is five times larger than Earth.</div><br>
		<div class="biobox">The Warp Zone – <br>
		A mostly secret underground room in Fort Aspara, Korous, where a circle of transportalizers to various locations resides. The list of locations includes the following; Desertia (represented by a Time gear), New Charcherry (represented by a cherry tree), Hepi (represented by a snail), Autumnal (represented by a lemon), Land of DLC and Challenges (represented by an “EA”), Spaceport Mall (represented by a space ship), the Eros Machina (represented by a semi truck), and Kisibuza (represented by a person with four arms). Each transportalizer has a hologram projected above it to represent each location. Total number of transportalizers present may vary over time.</div><br>
		<div class="biobox">The Spaceport – <br>
		A massive and complex structure in space, home to a variety of things such as a large shopping mall, various hotels and apartments, auditoriums for events, and a station where hundreds of ships depart from and arrive to. The Credit is used here for the main currency, but there are also currency transfers available. If one does not own a ship, they can take a commercial flight from here to another planet’s spaceport. It is said that this spaceport is part of a much larger mall chain, which is based on a mall planet, but this has yet to be investigated.</div><br>
		<div class="biobox">Hotdoggin – <br>
		A beachy planet found in the same solar system as the mysteriously missing planet Thirdinaltupp, this is the home of some quite lovely vacation spots. This planet is currently colonized by Thirdinaltupp refugees, who were in space at the time of their home planet’s disappearance. Hotdoggin is a part of the Federation and has commercial flights that come along from select locations.</div><br>
		<div class="biobox">Hepi – <br>
		A planet that is vaguely Earth-like and home to Hepians, also Meika, Amaia, and Mai’s home planet. Two main locations visited are Kanjaweii (also known as the Village of Flowers), and the Capital City. Kanjaweii is Mei and Mai’s hometown, a small town best known for their large assortment of flowers that grow there naturally all year. The Capital City is the capital of all of Hepi and one of the bigger and busier cities on the planet. It is also home to the Capital City Laboratories. </div>
		<h3>Memos:</h3>
		<div class="biobox">#dungeon-crashers – <br>
		The home memo for the Dungeon Crashers, a group dedicated to taking down VoidCo dungeons. It is a public memo, and anyone can discover it. While sometimes the topic is focused on dealing with the aforementioned dungeons, any sort of topic is talked about here. It is usually used as a way to communicate with the group as a whole. </div><br>
		<h3>Known Voidco Dungeons:</h3>
		<div class="biobox">Ancient Expo Center – <br>
		Found on the planet Kisibuza. Tackled by Heir of Time Rise Emit, Knight of Void Jamie, Maid of Heart Rustye Furreh, Bard of Void Nate, Rogue of Heart Charles [REDACTED], and Witch of Time Katyleen Kitten. Dungeon core was dismantled via bomb. Two Tetrach statues were taken from the dungeon and placed into Charcherry Town Square. The dungeon was demolished after being cleared. Fortunately no local residents were harmed thanks to it being evacuated already.</div>
		<div class="biobox">Dungeon500 – <br>
		Found on planet Grass 13. Tackled by Witch of Time Katie Kitten, Heir of Hope Hazel Careon, Prince of Time Garnett Garren, Heir of Time Rise Emit, Rogue of Heart Charles [ REDACTED ], Mei of planet Hepi, Knight of Space Smoke, and Bard of Void Nate. Dungeon core was already deactivated, as it was formerly a VoidCo owned building but sold off to someone by the name of “wateryDM” and converted into an extension of the original Dungeon500 of SBARGv2’s LoCaL. Android *Aperture and CruxiteBuddySprite were saved from this dungeon. It is theorized that one could reach the original Dungeon500 through here, but the whims of WateryDM likely wouldn't allow it.</div><br>
		<div class="biobox">Underground Hideout – <br>
		Found on the planet Korous. Tackled by Witches of Time Katyleen Kitten (Alpha and Delta), Bounty hunter Samus Kitten, Rogue of Heart Charles, *Aperture, Princess of Space Brae Emit, Heir of Time Rise Emit, and Heir of Life Amy. Special guests, Warlock of Time Coleman, mysterious figure Anyan, travelling salesman Mike, Morcant the squiddle, Coral the slime, and “The Architect” (Page of Light Tracy).  Additional guests *Jackbot, *Aperture. Dungeon core was deactivated by being overloaded by Katie via the powerCity. Princes of Time Garnett Garren and Travis Entropa were saved from this dungeon. It was formerly a doomsday shelter ran by a cult leader whose lust for immortality spelt doom for the rest of the group.</div><br>
		<div class="biobox">Frigid laboratory – Found on planet Creknam. Tackled by Witch of Time Katyleen Kitten, Warlock of Time Coleman, Ex-sprite Buddy, *Aperture, Mage of Light Nick Card, Page of Light Tracy, and Maid of Heart Rustye Furreh. Special guest Wasp. Dungeon core was already busted. Overall it was a scary place that the group shouldn't have visited in the first place.</div><br>
		<div class="biobox">Purity Temple – <br>
		Found on Starter Planet, right on the edge of charcherry forest. Tackled by Rogue of Heart Charles, Delta timeline Witch of Time Katyleen Kitten, Page of Light Tracy, Warlock of Time Coleman, Bounty Hunter Samus, Prince of Time River, Knight of Space Zowera, and Knight of Void Jamie. This dungeon had gone into overdrive, managing to drain an entire mile around it. The dungeon core was covered in flesh, and reportedly blew itself up. The temple collapsed, leaving a pit of lava behind. Some felt regretful that they could not save the doomed souls that resided in the mound of flesh. A day or two later, the party members received a thank-you letter from VoidCo, containing a friendcoin. Nowadays it is a hot spot for finding fire type pokemon.</div><br>
		<div class="biobox">Sea Saw Mine – <br>
		Found on planet Hotdoggin. Tackled by Heir of Time Rise, Rogue of Heart Charles, Ace Prosecutor Lightyears Edgeworth, Heir of Void Jamie, Bounty Hunter Samus, small child Drazra, Rise's Fae sister Brae Emit, and Page of Light Tracy. Dungeon core was blown up by a bomb. Nico of Earth, Heir of Hope Hazel Careon, Mai of Hepi, Witch of Time Katyleen Kitten, and Mage of Light Nick Card were saved from the dungeon. A dreambubble had been generated from this dungeon during and a few days after halloween, which had allowed ghosts to appear on resort grounds, as well as a dangerous imagined doppelganger of Rise called Ruse. This bubble deflated until it only filled a single bathtub, haunted by the late resort owner, who still regrets making deals with voidco to this very day. The dungeon crashers can stay here any time they like if desired, though the island's economy is in a precarious position. There is a stargate located here at least.</div><br>
		<div class="biobox">Aviary City's Temple of Doom – <br>
		Found on planet Roostar. Tackled by Heir of Breath June Egbert, Rogue of Heart Charles, Witch of Time Katyleen Kitten, Bounty Hunter Samus, and Heir of Void Mimi SoandSo. Dungeon core was destroyed by an unshielded Stargate blast. The city was preciously saved from The Reckoning by voidco, and presumedly they had erected a dungeon underneath the city to exact their payment for the service. Planet Roostor is a rather recent member of The Federation, and has a group of SBIRB players that now act as another branch of dungeon crashers when the main one is unavailable.</div><br>
		<div class="biobox">Ship in a Bottle – <br>
		Found somewhere in space not too far from the space colony that had left Augataur!Earth many years ago. Tackled by Mai of Hepi, Bounty hunter Samus Kitten, Witch of Time Katyleen Kitten, Rogue of Heart Charles, Magical Fae Brae Emit, and Heir of Time Rise Emit. Dungeon core was blown up by Brae's lemon bombs, detonated by her sibling's fire magic. Page of Mind Samm was saved from the dungeon. The dungeon had been literally crashed when charles made the transport warship collide with the bottle, eliminating all but the undead monsters that were stationed there. A cursed orb was retrieved from this dungeon, now held in an extremely secure location.</div><br>
		<div class="biobox">Shellderspire Isle - <br>
		Located on the opposite side of Starter Planet relative to New Charcherry, It was a dungeon built on a manmade island next to Slowpoke Island, designed to drain the slowpoke and other nearby pokmemon of their energy. The party included Page of Rage Jovin Castle, his machop Hercules, Page of Mind Samm, with her Munna, Witch of Time Crowchaser, with her golett Clayton, Bounty hunter Samus, Brae Emit, and her slowbro Pokey, as well as her clefable Stella, Rogue of Heart Charles, Heir of Time Rise Emit, and their torracat Shadow, and their gold dragon companion Goldie. The core was launched into deep space for disposal, which caused the core room to fill with water. The island is now a protected pokemon refuge, no longer dangerous after the core was removed.</div><br>
				<div class="biobox">Void Lighting - <br>
		Located at the spaceport mall, it was a department store ran by voidco which sold a variety of miniature dungeon cores marketed as nightlights. The team assembled included Prince of Time Aeons Edgeworth, Bounty Hunter Samus Kitten, her wife Witch of Time President Katyleen Kitten, Netnavi Splashwoman, and Figment Dimension President Cy. The cores were disposed of by Cy, who wisked them away to another dimension, where they would never harm anyone ever again. In a photo recovered by Enker, it was discovered that an unknown but terrifying figure dubbed "The Black Knight" was present with the spaceport higher-ups that welcomed voidco to the aquired storefront.</div><br>
		<div class="biobox">Frog Temple - <br>
		Located in a freezing cave at Jingloria's south pole, it is said to be the largest voidco dungeon ever discovered. One must apparently traverse the dungeon to access the shortcut to the SBRIGHT session. It has yet to be tackled.</div><br>
