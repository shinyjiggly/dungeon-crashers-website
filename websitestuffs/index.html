		<h2>Welcome to the Dungeon Crashers website!!</h2>
		<h3>UPDATES:</h3>
		<div class="biobox">2/20/23<br><img src="mainaeons.png"/><br>Finally updated something over here! Made a landing page for <a href="leftbeef.html">None Pizza With Left Beef</a>, as well as added some other things...?<br>
		Also removed the bullets on the menu because they were taking up too much space. For some reason the no bullets styled bullets didn't work? <br>
		shrug.</div>
		<div class="biobox">6/27/22<br><img src="mainaeons.png"/><br>Managed to get some stuff fixed here. Some of the broken links were repaired, some image extensions were capitalized (why in the heck does it throw a fit on if PNG is in caps or not???), and made the boxes look more pleasing to the eyes. If anything breaks, contact me over pestercord or <a href="mailto:agent_tat@hotmail.com?Subject=none" target="_top"> via email</a>.</div>
		<div class="biobox">6/25/22<br><img src="mainaeons.png"/><br>First!!1!1one! This should likely be the launch of the website tonight. Two particular pages have yet to be made entirely (Meet the Dungeon Crashers and Locations of Interest) but honestly I've had this site under wraps for far too long and need to get it launched. </div>
