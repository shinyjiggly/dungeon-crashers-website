		<p>Welcome to the out of character section of the website! To view the website as the characters of dungeon crashers can see it, append <span style="color:red">?icMode=True</span> to the end of the url. 
		<br>This does not work on webpages located outside of this website. (it took a while just to get it working here!)</p>
		<p>(note for later: make it so ooc-marked pages do not show content in the main area if viewed in ic mode)</p>
		<p>I am one of the many authors involved in this long-running text-based roleplay. My name is Nick, but feel free to call me SJMun in this context. Some of us like to make up elemental forms to be seen as, but idk, that's not particularly my style.</p>
		<p>As for the duct tape? We use that around here to keep the 4th wall intact. It has been broken and even shattered in the past, but if taken too far without attentive care, such violations of the barrier can sour things for everyone involved. This manifest as a swarm of bloodthirsty furbies that attack anyone who dares to cross them. So far, there has only been two incidents where the furbies have been unleashed in a doomed timeline, and we hope it stays that way around here.</p>
