Meet the dungeon crashers!
While I'm certain that there are those oitside of this group that might also crash dungeons like we do, these are the ones that I know personally that work together to a degree from time to time.

Name: Aeons Edgeworth
Title: Prince of Time
Occupation(s): Detective, investigative reporter, pokemon snack cook
Chumhandle: shinyJiggly
Pronouns: they/them
Age: somewhere between 20, 28, and 34 
(time stuff and multiple selves stuff is weird)
Height: 5'4"
Session of origin: SBARGv2
Bio: 
Generally known for being relatively level-headed and very knowlegable about weird time stuff. Their method of choice for avoiding doomed timelines is to try and use common sense to prevent disasters from occurring in the first place. Aeons is also known for pioneering the anchor timehop technique, an advanced tech that allows one to travel through space by travelling through time relative to a moving object. They always try to do time stuff with percision and generally do not like the class they were given, as they do not like destroying things, let alone something as valuable as time. Aeons has changed their name a number of times since transitioning nonbinaryways. Not actually related to any known prosecutors of the same surname, they just admire a certain one's style a little too much.

Name: Nick Card
Title: Mage of Light
Occupation(s): Newsletter journalist
Chumhandle: lavenderSiren
Pronouns: they/them
Age: 27
Height: 5'3"
Session of origin: SBARGv1
Bio: 
The somewhat more neurotic and anxious sibling of Aeons, Nick has some issues sometimes, possibly stemming from their past residency on a meteor in the furthest ring for a few years. They spend their free time working on video games (which tend to come true via light bullshit) and their ongoing webcomic. Nick is incredibly powerful, boasting a devistating solar beam attack, but rarely has an occasion to use such power. They also have many ways to travel to places, including to other dimensions, thanks to the many artifacts they've recieved over the past year or two.


Name: Katyleen Kitten
Title: Witch of Time
Occupation(s): President of Desertia, Ace Attourney, potion alchemist
Chumhandle: powerKitten
Pronouns: she/her
Age: 27? (been through a lot of timeloops)
Height: 6'6"
Session of origin: SBARGv2
Bio: 
A time player who has learned much in her years sorting through her chaotic timeloops. She has a passion for computer science and video games. She drives a spaceworthy version of the Hornet to work nearly every day. Years ago, the red rift incident caused her to become entangled with countless other versons of herself across countless timelines, essentially ascending her to ultimate tier. Because darker facets of herself threatened to tear her apart, she had to be rebuilt as a cyborg, while still bearing the mark of a self-prototyping with moon-moon, the infamous meme wolf. Her once happy-go-lucky demenor has tempered over the years, though she has not lost this spark entirely. The responsabilities of a world leader can ber taxing at times. Through complete bullshit schenanegans, she has established a metaphysical link with Charles.

Name: Hazel Careon
Title: Heir of Hope
Occupation(s): Roboticist?
Chumhandle: rechargedNintendo
Pronouns: she/her
Age: 20?
Height: 5'4"
Session of origin: SBARGv1
Bio: 
A rather solitary and pensive woman still reeling from the horrors of war and loss, she was once the Battle Commander of Prospit Batallion 575-A back in her session. The Choice with her denizen gave her an animalistic alter ego, which carries her forward in times of strife and conflict. She feels somewhat out of place in more recent times of peace however. She likes building robots so much that she even built a robot body for her girlfriend, a previously decomissioned catgirl AI from another dimension.

Name: Charles [Redacted]
Title: Rogue of Heart
Occupation(s): inventor/scientist?
Chumhandle: frozenLake
Pronouns: He/They
Age: 27
Height: 5'7"
Session of origin: SBARGv2
Bio: 
Known for being the master of disaster, Charles has caused a great deal of chaos over the years. Their creations tend to be quite advanced and very useful, but that doesn't stop them from getting into trouble. Charles can sense the feelings of others to a degree, but does not always know what to do about this, usually opting to stay out of most situations. He has a strong sense of justice, which has gotten them in trouble on at least one occasion. Charles was combined with twelve varying versions of themself shortly before Thoren and Raine's wedding. Charles does a lot of punchcard alchemy and has learned the ins and outs of the system quite well. They have also managed to construct the most reliable set of stargates to be found in the tadpole galaxy, to the point of becoming an industry standard. 

Name: Samus Kitten

A bounty hunter by trade, Samus lends her expertise to the dungeon crashers by joining them on dungeon raids on occasion. After the tragic death of Katie's former fiancee, Mei, Samus became more involved in Katie's personal life. They eventually got married, but have yet to have a public ceremony. Much about her is a mystery. Where did she get that gravity suit? was she raised by bird people?

Chumhandle: awesomeSwordfish
Pronouns: she/her
Age: at least 3000 years old
Height: 5'4"?
Session of origin: SBARGv2
Bio: 
After the game, Samm went off to a version of earth crafted meticulously by a time player, only to be trapped there with her husband Jovin for thousands of years, forced to watch civilizations and communities crumble as part of the time player's grand design. She still longs for the days she once spent with the phoenix people long ago. Either by red rift or awakening of her mind powers, I'm not sure which, Samm ascended to ultimate tier in a plural manner. There are versions of herself that she does not like to embrace as much, due to wildly differing moral conclusions. Figuring out how to handle this is an ongoing thing for her.

He spent those countless years focusing on training his body. In this day and age, Jovin is a force to be reckoned with. He has successfully prevented an apocolyptic event by punching a meteor, and generally tends to rise to the challenge in times of crisis. His encounters with pokemon that join his party tend to be very myth-like.

She has become rather skilled with magic recently.

His time during the session was largely spent on a desert land, and he was later found wandering the desert planet of korous.

One of the two ectobiologically created players of their session. They were originally destined to become the timespace monster who created them, and this was fulfilled, to a degree. Though the version of Thoren who awakened upon doubletiering was lost forever to the blackprince virus, the one who descended to the underworld was preserved. Thoren has grown consideribly since then, having connected to others and learned to care about more than their previous dark destiny. They hold a lot of remorse for their past but have tried to move on from this to a degree. Thoren is married to a lord of Rage by the name of Raine, and uses a highly customized soulbot to walk among the living. They are very task-driven.

A forgotten player who was conscripted to finish the job of cleaning and repairing the medium of the SBARGv2 session. For the longest time, she had been consigned to travelling to various lands to cleanse them of bugs and errors, but this was often a thankless task, though she took her duty seriously.
Nowadays, Blaze is taking a much needed break from her gruelling mission, having been cleaned of personal errors enough to walk through the endgame door.
